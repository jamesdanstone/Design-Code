<section class="projects"><div class="flex flex--center"><div class="col-2"><div class="header-arrow"></div><h2 class="large home-lead">A collection of<br/>my work & ideas</h2><p>Below are a few of the projects I have worked on, and ideas for the future. I see each project as an opportunity to learn new skills and improve what I thought was already mastered. With the accessability of technology improving every single day, I try to push myself by using different tools and techniques wherever possible. <br/><br/>This collection features work produced for business, events, sports teams and personal projects. I am currently an independent freelancer but  open to possible representation. So please get in touch if you would like to work with me. </p><p class="quote"><span>“All joy comes from creation, allow others to indulge in consumption.”</span></p></div><div class="col-2 order-last"><div class="flex-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/89sacBIEq4g?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div></section>
