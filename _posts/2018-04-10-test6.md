title: Logo design
description: These are some of the logos I have designed, it is a part of graphic design which I really enjoy. You get the lovely warm feeling of a finished project over a relatively short period of time, and each offers a different challenge! I recently took on the 30 day logo challenge in an attempt to hone my skills and try out some new design ideas. If you think I could help with your new logo or branding, get in touch.
tools: Photoshop, XD, AE, Illustrator
